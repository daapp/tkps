tkps (1.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Package is orphaned; maintainer set to Debian QA Group.  Bugs
    fixed by previous NMUs can be closed.  Closes: #44285, #76968,
    #91675.  (The changelog doesn't mention it, but a menu entry has
    been added.)
  * Since I haven't been able to track down the original sources, and
    the previous maintainer enhanced tkps quite a bit, I'm building
    it as a Debian native package (which is certainly better than
    keeping the Debian packaging in the .orig.tar.gz).
  * meminfo: While parsing /proc/*/status, rely on labels instead of
    line numbers, which have changed.
  * tkps: Use BSD ps option syntax rather than I_WANT_A_BROKEN_PS.
  * Conforms to Standards version 3.5.6:
    * Moved /usr/lib/tkps to /usr/share/tkps and /usr/X11R6/bin/tkps
      to /usr/bin/tkps.
